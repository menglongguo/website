*Blue* is a low-cost, human-size, and compliant 7 degree of freedom arm with a 2kg payload.
It was developed from scratch in the [Robot Learning Lab](http://rll.berkeley.edu/) under [Professor Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) as a low-cost platform to democratize robotic research.
I worked on this project from my 3rd to final year of my undergraduate degree.
What began in 2017 as a concept, is now a platform available for researchers (more information is available [here](https://www.berkeleyopenarms.org/)).
