This research was on a novel surgical device for supervised autonomous surgeries.
The work was done under Professor [Ken Goldberg's](https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/) Automation Lab ([Autolab](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/)).

The part I designed was a tool change end effector that would facilitate automated switching between instruments of the DaVinci robot system.
This work was published in IEEE's International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering ([Case 2016](https://case2016.org/)).

### Motivation and Concept

Over 570,000 procedures in 2014 are done with Robotic Surgical Assistants where a surgeon tele-operates robotic appendages to perform sugical tasks.
These Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgical (RMIS) procedures like tumorectomy and prostatectomy are done with very high sucess rates.
The goal is to replace certain portions of the pure tele-operations with supervised autonomous operation in order to reduce tedium, fatigue, and time.
This paper introduces a novel interchangeable surgical end-effector system with a tool change device to save surgical time.

### Design

I worked primarily on the catch basin end effector attachment that facilitates instrument switching.
