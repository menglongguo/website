title: Blue- A Low-Cost 7 DOF Arm and Gripper
year: Spring17- Spring19
order: 104
stlwv2_models: yes
type: research

*Blue* is a low-cost, human-size, and compliant 7 degree of freedom arm with a 2kg payload.
It was developed from scratch in the [Robot Learning Lab](http://rll.berkeley.edu/) under [Professor Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) as a low-cost platform to democratize robotic research.
What began in 2017 as a concept, is now a platform available for researchers (more information is available [here](https://www.berkeleyopenarms.org/)).

The work was published in the IEEE's International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2019), the Arxiv link is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03815) and a copy is shown below:

### Hand Design

I was in charge of the end effector on the team.
Seeing that there wasn't a gripper that fulfills all of *blue's* requirements for this type of research application, I set out to design and manufacture one.

The design constraints included:
- Low cost: A less-expensive hand will lower the barrier of entry for research. The final Bill of Material cost was $330.
- Durable: Robotic experiements sees a lot of collisions between end effector and environment. The HALT testing shows it could withstand 50,000 low speed impact collisions and 4,000 high speed collisions (video below).

In hopes of growing the field of research in robotic grippers,we open-sourced the designs [here](https://berkeleyopengrippers.github.io/).
