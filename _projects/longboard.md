I spent most of my junior and senior years of high school designing and building a motorized longboard.

### Features
- single reduction drivetrain powered by two 270Kv brushless outrunners
- custom main control PCB
- 6 mile range & 22mph top speed powered by a 5Ah 6S LiCoO2 battery
- CNC-milled motor mounts, with a waterjetted electronics mounting plate (doubles as a heatsink)
- 3D printed electronics enclosure
- eight individually addressable RGB status LEDs (all purple in picture)
- on-board 90W CC/CV battery charging circuit, powered by my laptop's AC adapter

### Remote

<div class="stlwv2-model" data-model-url="/website/assets/models/longboard_remote.stl"></div>

I developed a wireless remote to control my longboard. It charges over USB, and contains a 900mAh lithium battery that lasts for 36+ hours of use.

The electronics were designed in Altium and built around an ATmega32u4 MCU/nRF24L01+ 2.4Ghz wireless transciever IC.
