In my free time, I enjoy the process of making art and trying out new mediums & techniques.
As a mechanical engineer and roboticist, I try to imbue as much art into the design process and the physical objects.

*Copy of Drawing Hands*
Sketching was the first form of art I learned.
I always loved the theme of cycles and paradox, so I drew this copy of MC Esher's Drawing Hands (I think sometimes back in middle school).

*Taking Flight*
Just a simple sketch of bird taking flight (also was done in middle school).

*Colorful Bird*
I also explored color pencil as it was closest to sketching.
Color layering was a new and challenging feature in this medium (done sometime in middle school).

*Tranquility in Solitude*
Yes, you can laugh at the title, I drew this when I was 11, so that was prime edgy teen age. 

![Duality of Mind](/website/assets/images/MindWCbrighter.jpg)
*Duality of the Mind*
I made this in an art class in 8th grade.
Watercolor was very difficult to control but can create such vibrant and delicate features.

*Reflections at Night*
I took a long hiatus from art throughout high school.
I tried to resurrect my old past-time by painting from a photo my roommate took (you should check out Cody's amazing photography [here](http://www.codylimberphotography.com/))!
This is arguably the most beautiful section of the UC Berkeley campus: the reflecting pool in front of Stanley Hall (I hope I did it justice)!
This was my first attempt painting and I just remembered how long it took to wait and re-paint over existing segments (done in freshman year in college).

![Campanile when Blue](/website/assets/images/CampMIXdarker.jpg)
*Campanile when Blue*
Once a while, the Campanile Tower is showered in blue light for festival events.
This was my attempt to capture the sight in colored pencil (done in freshman year of college).

![Horse Standing](/website/assets/images/Horse2MB.jpg)
*Horse Standing #3*
This was my first forray into Chinese painting and calligraphy. 
Unlike many other mediums, you can't erase or cover up any stroke, you have to have the conviction and plan the moment your brush makes contact.
Everything happens so quickly with each drawing taking about 5 minutes.
This isn't a very good painting by any means but I was proud of it being the 3rd horse I ever drew.

*Horse Galloping #4*
I drew both of these in the junior year of college, and hopefully they mark the beginning of a lot of hardwork and practice.
