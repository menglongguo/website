In my free time, I enjoy the process of making art and trying out new mediums & techniques.
As a mechanical engineer and roboticist, I try to imbue as much art into the design process and the physical objects.

*Copy of Drawing Hands*
![Escher Hands](/website/assets/images/1HandsPbrighter.jpg)
Sketching was the first form of art I learned.
I always loved the theme of cycles and paradox, so I drew this copy of MC Esher's Drawing Hands (I think sometimes in middle school).

*Taking Flight*
![Bird in Hand](/website/assets/images/1BirdHandPbrighter.jpg)
Just a simple sketch of bird taking flight (also done in middle school).

*Colorful Bird*

I also explored color pencil as it was closest to sketching.
Color layering was a new and challenging feature in this medium (done sometime in middle school).


*Tranquility in Solitude*

Yes, you can laugh at the title, I drew and named this when I was 11.
I still enjoy how calming it makes me feel. 

*Duality of the Mind*

I made this in an art class in 8th grade.
Watercolor was very difficult to control but can create such vibrant and delicate features.

*Reflections at Night*

I took a long hiatus from art throughout high school.
I tried to resurrect my old past-time by painting from a photo my roommate took (you should check out Cody's amazing photography [here](http://www.codylimberphotography.com/))!
This is arguably the most beautiful section of the UC Berkeley campus: the reflecting pool in front of Stanley Hall (I hope I did it justice)!
This was my first attempt painting and I just remembered how long it took to wait and re-paint over existing segments (done in freshman year in college).

*Campanile when Blue*

Once a while, the Campanile Tower is showered in blue light for festival events.
This was my attempt to capture the sight in colored pencil (done in freshman year).

*3D Printed Art*

When I first learned how to 3D print, I had an idea that I could cad art.
To get different colors, I would calculate and time each filament change.
I enjoyed playing with this idea of art in the 3d printed medium!


*Horse Standing #3*
![Horse Standing](/website/assets/images/1Horse3.jpg)
This was my first attempt into Chinese painting and calligraphy. 
Unlike many other mediums, you can't erase or cover up any stroke, you have to have the conviction and plan the moment your brush makes contact.
Everything happens very quickly (each drawing taking about 5 minutes) so it's very easy to see the level of one's brush technique. 
This isn't a very good painting by any means but I was proud of it being the 3rd horse I ever painted.

*Horse Galloping #4*
![Horse Galloping](/website/assets/images/1Horse4.jpg)
I painted both of these in the junior year, and I hope I continue to improve in the craft!
