My family is from the south of China that is known for a lighter style of cooking with mellow sauces, focusing more on texture than flavor.
On the other hand, I grew up in the US and that has exposed me to the melting pot of cooking techniques and ethnic styles. 
Both these influences has largely shaped my palette and merged into an unique approach to cooking!
Below are some dishes I have made and experimented with!

### Baking

*Mochi Muffin (small)*
A [Berkeley store](https://thirdculturebakery.com/) sells these amazing mochi muffins that are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.
I tinkered for a while in an attempt to match the texture of the original.
They came out pretty good in all their forms!
