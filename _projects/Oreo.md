I had to design a device for my planar mechanism class that utilized one of the many gear mechanisms taught.
I chose the geneva drive and build a silly device that scrapes the white cream from the chocolate oreo cookie.

### Mechanism Design

The geneva drive was chosen to translate the motor's continuous motion into intermitent rotations. 
This allows for discrete loading and scraping actions in each stage.
Below shows the diagram of each stage as the center motor spins.

Overall, it was a fun challenge to design this device in a week even if it's for a silly purpose!
