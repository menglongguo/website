title: Fingertip Sensor for Haptic Manipulation
year: Spring 21  - Present
order: 105
stlwv2_models: yes
type: research2
---

Alongside my main research project (the Robotic Hand), I continued the current project on a fingertip sensor.
The motivation of the project was to develop a sensor to be mounted at the end of a robotic hand/end-effector that can sense the direction of external forces and the location of the contact.
This work was a continuation of Michael Chuah's PhD research and Lindsey Epstein's Master's thesis.
While I worked mostly on the manufacturing, training software, and integration, Andrew Salatous and Adi Mehrota worked on building the testing platform and the sensor electronics.
As this project required reverse-engineering and improving an existing system, it focused more on data analysis, documentation, system-design, manufacturing, and troubleshooting.

### Upgrade to the Manufacturing Process

After reverse-engineering how the system worked, I decided to rebuild the system from the ground up as the codebase was too messy and the testing platform was too complex to operate.
Almost the whole process was changed: the delta arm replacing the CNC mill testing platform, Matlab and python replacing labview and C++. 
As a result, it gave a lot of opportunities to improve the process along with a lot of new issues to troubleshoot if the methodology deviated too much.
