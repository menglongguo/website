title: Fingertip Sensor for Haptic Manipulation
year: Spring 21  - Present
order: 105
stlwv2_models: yes
type: research2
---

Alongside my main research project (the Robotic Hand), I continued a previous student's work on a fingertip sensor.
(background of the project)
(introduce the people (lindsey and Chuah) as well as andrew and adi that helped)
(lay out how most of this will be revamping the old method to the new one- documentation, reverse-engineering, system-design, manufacturing, troubleshooting, matlab)
