When I happened upon the [Design institute](https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, I discovered the world of “making”. 
As a result, I spent a lot of my first two years in college exploring this space through many interesting (and sometimes failed) projects.

### Phone case

This 3D printed case design has been my most used (and arguably essential) gadget. 
It attaches 2 keys and my student ID to my phone, simplifying everything I need into the palm of my hand. 
As I switched apartments and phones (5 in-between iterations not shown) through my 4 years of bachelors, the design has evolved with my changing needs.

### Lap Desk

The *lapdesk* project was to make note-taking more ergonomic but ended up as an exploration of plywood construction. 
Thinking about ways to make laser-cut planes of plywood bend and curve was an interesting challenge. 
Unfortunately, I never used this because it was impractical to carry and not much more ergonomic than regular note-taking. 
Although I did enjoy the experience, my biggest takeaway is this: if you prioritize the journey over the destination, the product will sometimes be useless.

### Flute Case

This *flutecase* provided a protective casing for transport and storage of the delicate instrument. 
I really enjoyed the double bayonet design (I didnt know this mechanism existed until someone told me what it was!) to transport the split flute in a more compact form factor. 
The slots allowed me to decorate the exterior with Chinese poems laser-engraved on strips of wood and plastic.

### Phone Arm

This gadget allowed me to fix my phone in space to take pictures for studying or display videos while cooking. 
It was a fun and sleek design but couldn’t outperform the plethora of phone-holding gadgets available on Amazon.

### ABB point gripper

This was a gripper was created for [Autolab](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/) to simulate a point contact with embedded ball bearings.

### Davinci Test Setup

Of all the experimental hardware I built for the [Autolab](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/), this one was the most memorable. 
It was my first exposure to the creative and complex world of machining (I had no idea what mills were until freshman year). 
I still remember Jessie of the ME machine shop showing me what an auto tapper was, saving me from the foolish quest of tapping 250 holes by hand.

### Mathematically Generated Designs

The blue wave structure was generated using recursive math equations in a program called [Structure Synth](http://structuresynth.sourceforge.net/). 
The white organic-looking sphere is made from a Voronoi pattern as a design-athon project to create an elegant night light. 
I always enjoy exploring the intersection of design and math!

### Cycloidal

I tried making a [cycloidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloidal_drive) gearbox transmission for a bldc gimbal motor. 
It worked ok without any load but seize up once any load was added (mostly due to lack of precision machining and experience).

### 3d Printer Failure Notes

This was a quick idea to laser-cut generic 3d printer failure notes on post-it notes for the makerspace. 
I like to indulge the sporadic design spark, especially for quick projects testing new techniques!

### Brush Case

This simple case stores my brushes and also transforms into a paintbrush stand. 
Looking back, the relatively weak laser-cut fingers and acrylic glue joints held it back from being robustly used.

### Audio Mixer Cover

One of my electrical engineering friends asked me to make a cover for his audio mixer. 
I wanted a sleek design and a user-friendly edge so I bent acrylic to form a nice rounded surface.

### Clothing Organizer

Just a quick illustrator exercise to make a formal wear organizer.
