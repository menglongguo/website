### Gary Gin Tshirt

![GaryInPit](/website/assets/images/12Garywithshirt.jpg)

I designed this Tshirt to feature [Gary Gin](https://twitter.com/botdriver?lang=en), a well-known robot builder/driver on the ["BattleBots"](https://battlebots.com/robot/free-shipping-2018/) show on Discovery Channel (also a grumpy design specialist at UC Berkeley's Jacobs Hall).
I really enjoyed the design's simplicity yet distinctiveness.
It has even gained a following with over 300 tshirts out in the world! 
The design can now be purchased through [Teespring](https://teespring.com/shop/gary_is_watching?pid=369&cid=6512) and [Battlebots](https://www.battlebotsstore.com/index.php?route=product/search&search=gary).

### Hydra (Frisbee Team) Tshirt

![Hydra](/website/assets/images/12HydraShirts.jpg)

When I was the captain of Hydra, an intramural ultimate frisbee team, I designed the logo and manually heat-pressed the shirts.
It only cost 4-5 dollars as oppose to 3-4 times that using a custom Tshirt website (although it took 4 hrs to vinyl cut and press 20 shirts).

### HydraFreecs (Frisbee Team) Tshirt

After merging Hydra with the Freecs, another intramural team whose logo was a bear, I made new shirts.
I particularly enjoyed designing this logo because it incorporates both a dragon and a bear using the negative space and [Gestalt principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology).
