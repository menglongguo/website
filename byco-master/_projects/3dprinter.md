### Overview

I really wanted a 3D printer at some point, but they were still really expensive!

Using some tweaked open source designs (specifically the [Prusa i3](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3) and [Wilson](http://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Wilson)), an Arduino microcontroller, and a used XBox 360 power supply, I built this open-frame printer for ~$230.

Features:
- single 3mm filament extruder with a 0.5mm nozzle
- 8" x 8" x 7" build volume
